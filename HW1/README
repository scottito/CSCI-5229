I started from ex6 code. I was inspired by ex8 to add some idle activity. I implemented the lorenz attractor code from lorenz.c provided on Canvas and added additional points. 
I modified display() to use GL_LINE_STRIP for plotting. I tweaked initial parameters and added a w to plotting to fit more complex plots closer to the origin.
