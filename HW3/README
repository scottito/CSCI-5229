Homework 3 - Incorporate lighting and textures into a scene.
I stuck with my scene of satellites orbiting "Earth".

Key bindings
  Space      Stop/Start light source motion
  m/M        Cycles scene being viewed
  e/E        decrease/increase emitted light
  n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
  []         Lower/rise light
  x          Toggle axes
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

      (First-person mode)
  w          move camera forward
  a          move camera left
  s          move camera back
  d          move camera right
 
    (Projection Mode)
  a/A        decrease/increase ambient light
  d/D        decrease/increase diffuse light
  s/S        decrease/increase specular light

I started from ex15 code because it includes examples of both lighting and textures. I kept my satellite object model from homework 2 and defined normals to light it correctly. 
For satellite normals I referenced ex13, specifically cylinders and spheres. I used ChatGPT a bit to help me set up glTexCoords.

This homework was hard.

I am not quite satisfied with the lighting on the satellite dish because the outside of the dish should cast a shadow on the inside. However, since we have not covered shadows yet
I will wait to make this adjustment.

Both original images from Google images and the BMPs I turned them into are in the img/ directory.

Time to complete: about 15 hours
