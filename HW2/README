View a scene in three dimensions. I chose to make my scene satellites orbiting "Earth".

Key bindings
  m          Toggle between orthogonal, perspective, and first-person
  +/-        Increase/decrease field of view
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  arrows     Change view angle
  1          View the whole scene
  2          View only satellite object
  3          View only Earth object
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit

  (in orthogonal or perspective)
  a          toggles axis
  (in first-person)
  w          move camera forward
  a          move camera left
  s          move camera back
  d          move camera right

I started from ex9 code. I referenced ex8's SolidPlane for tips drawing the satellite at unit scale. I got some help from ChatGPT responses for getting vectors for first-person movement.

My satellite design is based on a simple image I found at https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/4999212-satellite-isolated-on-the-white-background-vector-illustration
