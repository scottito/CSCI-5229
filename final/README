I wanted to build off of what I produced in the homeworks, but I recognized that just doing more with satellites was not going to be interesting enough for this project. Thus, I decided to tackle a FAR more complicated shape and make a cool spaceship.

For cartoon shading and loading shader functions I drew from ex25. For Gouraud shading I referenced ex37 and ClaudeSonnet. Shading was easier than I thought at first... and then it caused some problems. I am really proud of how I learned to navigate shaders better and go beyond the basic. I relied on help from the internet and AI to get my initial shaders to load textures so I could show Spike in the cockpit. However, after that I took it upon myself to write the shader that lights up the jet from the engine using a second light source. This was really challenging but rewarding as I feel it really pulls the whole project together.

Another thing I am proud of, even though it is small, is the canopy on the cockpit. We talked a little bit in class about making things transparent but actually getting it to work, and then putting shaders on top of it, required some finesse and I really like how mine turned out.

Time to complete: about 40 hours
